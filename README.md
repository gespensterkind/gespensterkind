**Backend & API Security | Embedded Systems | Smart Automation**

## About Me  
I'm an aspiring developer with a deep interest in **secure backend systems** and **API protection**, currently expanding into the world of **IoT**, **embedded development**, and **smart home automation**.
Currently I work hands-on with building automation, lighting systems, and network infrastructure.

My projects often explore:
- **ESP32 & ESPHome** for sensor-based automation  
- **Home Assistant** integrations and dashboard customization  
- **API & database security**, with a focus on hardening systems from the ground up
- **KNX & DALI lighting systems, Loxone integrations
- Raspberry Pi-based tools, like a Networkscannertool

I'm passionate about creating systems that are not just functional, but also resilient and transparent.
