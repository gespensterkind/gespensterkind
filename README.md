# 👻 Heyho, I'm Jule – alias *Gespensterkind* [ˈɡɛːʃpɛnstɐkɪnt]

🔐 **Backend & API Security | Embedded Systems | Smart Automation**

## 📝 About Me  
I'm a developer with a deep interest in **secure backend systems** and **API protection**, currently expanding into the world of **IoT**, **embedded development**, and **smart home automation**.

My projects often explore:
- 🧠 **ESP32 & ESPHome** for sensor-based automation  
- 🌿 **Smart plant care systems** (like [LuminPlant](https://github.com/gespensterkind/LuminPlant_HomeAssistantVersion))  
- 🏠 **Home Assistant** integrations and dashboard customization  
- 🔐 **API & database security**, with a focus on hardening systems from the ground up

I'm passionate about creating systems that are not just functional, but also **resilient, transparent, and respectful of user control**.
