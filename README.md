🔐 **Backend & API Security | Database Security | Secure Software Development**  

## 📝 About Me  
I work on **backend security, API protection, and database security**, with a focus on preventing vulnerabilities like SQL injections and API misconfigurations.  
I also enjoy **exploring security tools**, improving authentication mechanisms, and testing for vulnerabilities in web applications.  

Aside from security, I like working on **small coding projects**, building **puzzle-based games**, and experimenting with **pixel art**. I like how logic and creativity come together in both security and game development.
